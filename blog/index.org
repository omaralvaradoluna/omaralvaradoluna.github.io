** TCPSendBuf problems
written on: <2018-03-09 Fri>

Sometimes we can get errors in /var/log/messages about rsyslog 

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
... rsyslogd: omfwd: TCPSendBuf error -2027, destruct TCP Connection to logs-01.loggly.com:514 [v8.33.0 try http://www.rsyslog.com/e/2027 ]

#+END_SRC

it could be caused by a network connectivity interruption, but also by a misconfiguration in rsyslog files.

The /var/log/messages should be reviewd with a tail -f

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
tail -f /var/log/messages
#+END_SRC

We can restart rsyslog and see what is happening

If we need to look for TCPSendBuf inside serveral files it is easier with following command 

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
sudo grep -rnw './'  -e 'TCPSendBuf'
#+END_SRC


** Obtaining the most recent amazon machine image (AMI) with Ubuntu 16.04 LTS with aws cli and jq
written on: <2018-03-12 Mon>

First of all we have to obtain id of ubuntu provider, because we have to be confident that we have a secure source of the public ami. So you can find several ami's at https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/locator/ec2/

We get this id 099720109477.

So we can do a query, retrieving all images from owner-id 099720109477 and state available for architecture x86_64 

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
aws ec2 describe-images --filters "Name=owner-id,Values=099720109477" "Name=state,Values=available" "Name=architecture,Values=x86_64"
#+END_SRC

We'll add a query to retrieve all objects where name starts with `ubuntu/images/ebs-ssd/ubuntu-xenial-16.04`

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
--query 'Images[?Name!=`null`]|[?starts_with(Name, `ubuntu/images/ebs-ssd/ubuntu-xenial-16.04`) == `true` ]'
#+END_SRC

It is important to add a filter to retrieve only objects with name not equal to null, otherwise we'll get an error from aws cli.

Finally, with jq we'll sort the array with the .Name element,  in order to get the most recent image, we'll add reverse and first options

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
| jq -r 'sort_by( .Name ) | reverse | first | .
#+END_SRC

And it is done

#+BEGIN_SRC json
